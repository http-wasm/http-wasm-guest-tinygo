	// # Handling unsupported
	//
	// This is a feature flag because trailers are not well-supported. For
	// example, mosn does not support trailers.
	//
	// A host that doesn't support trailers must do the following:
	//   - return 0 for this bit in the FuncEnableFeatures result.
	//   - return no trailer names or values.
	//   - panic/trap on any call to set a trailer value.
	//
	// For example, a logging handler may be fine without trailers, while a
	// gRPC handler should err as it needs to access the gRPC status trailer. A
	// guest that requires trailers can fail during initialization instead of
	// per-request via inspecting the result of FuncEnableFeatures.
